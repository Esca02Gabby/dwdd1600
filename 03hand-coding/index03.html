        <h1>History</h1>
        <p>Simply put, The Marvel Cinematic Universe is an American media franchise and shared universe centered on a series of superhero films produced by Marvel Studios. The films are based on characters that appear in American comic books published by Marvel Comics.</p>
        
        <h2>How it started</h2>
        <p>Marvel made relatively little profit from its licensing deals with other studios and wanted to get more money out of its films while maintaining artistic control of the projects and distribution. Avi Arad, head of Marvel's film division, was pleased with Sam Raimi's Spider-Man films at Sony Pictures, but was less pleased with others. As a result, Arad decided to form Marvel Studios, Hollywood's first major independent film studio since DreamWorks. Kevin Feige, Arad's second-in-command, realized that unlike Spider-Man and the X-Men, whose film rights were licensed to Sony and Fox, respectively, Marvel still owned the rights to the core members of the Avengers. Feige, a self-described "fanboy", envisioned creating a shared universe, just as creators Stan Lee and Jack Kirby had done with their comic books in the early 1960s.</p>
        
        <h2>Stan Lee</h2>
        <p>Stan Lee (born Stanley Martin Lieber December 28, 1922 â€“ November 12, 2018) was an American comic book writer, editor, publisher, and producer. He rose through the ranks of a family-run business called Timely Publications which would later become Marvel Comics. In collaboration with others at Marvel particularly co-writers/artists Jack Kirby and Steve Ditko he co-created iconic characters, including superheroes Spider-Man, the X-Men, Iron Man, etc. Following his retirement from Marvel in the 1990s, Lee remained a public figurehead for the company, and frequently made cameo appearances in films and television shows based on Marvel characters. Making him well loved in the community </p>
        
        <h2>Films/TV Shows</h2>
        <p><strong>Marvel</strong> are well-known throughout the world. A couple of films that were the highest grossing MCU films worldwide were</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Guardians of the Galazy Vol.3 (2023)</li>
            <li>The Avengers: Endgame (2019)</li>
            <li>Avengers: Infinity War (2018)</li>
            <li>Spider-Man: No Way Home (2021)</li>
        </ol>
       
        <dl>
            <dt>Phase One</dt>
            <dd>During Phase One of the MCU, Iron Man 2 is set six months after the events of Iron Man. Several of Marvel's One-Shot films also occurred around the events of Phase One films.</dd>
            <dt>Phase Two</dt>
            <dd>Phase Two films were set roughly in real time relating to The Avengers: Iron Man 3 takes place about six months later, during Christmas. <em>Thor: The Dark World</em> is set one year later. Then Captain America: The Winter Soldier is two years after. Avengers: Age of Ultron and Ant-Man ended the phase in 2015, with several months passing between those films in-universe as in real life.</dd>
            <dt>Phase Three</dt>
            <dd>For Phase Three, directors the Russo brothers wanted to continue using real time, and so <a href="characters.html"#captian>Captain America</a>: Civil War begins a year after Age of Ultron, with Avengers: Infinity War set two years after that. Producer Brad Winderbaum said the Phase Three films would actually "happen on top of each other" while being less "interlocked" as the Phase One films were, with Black Panther and Spider-Man: Homecoming respectively beginning a week and several months after Civil War.</dd>
            <dt>Phase Four</dt>
            <dd>With Phase Four, Marvel Studios expanded into television series, which have greater interconnectivity with the MCU feature films than the series from Marvel Television. Many of the properties in the Phase are set after the events of Avengers: Endgame. WandaVision is set three weeks after the events of that film, and directly sets up Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness; The first season of Loki continues from the 2012 events seen in Endgame, but much of the series exists outside of time and space given the introduction of the Time Variance Authority. It also ties in with Multiverse of Madness. Now the What If...? is set after Loki's first season finale, exploring the various branching timelines of the newly created multiverse in which major moments from the MCU films occur differently.</dd>
            <dt>Phase Five</dt>
            <dd>Parts of <a href="https://marvelcinematicuniverse.fandom.com/wiki/Phase_Five" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> Phase 5</a> have been released but it is still in the works.</dd>
        </dl>
        <p>There are several other different kinds of films/tv shows like: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Ant-Man (2015)</li>
            <li>Black Widow (2021)</li>
            <li>Black Panther (2018)</li>
